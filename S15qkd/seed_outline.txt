Readevents to be called in blindmode 145, for mid-range density+timebase. This affects the overall countrate by 1-2%. The goal is to make the overall counts appear unchanged, while using the seeded counts to identify seeding operation.

Seeding Code outline
---

1. Obtain expected ratio (controller.py)
	Call readevents with -b 145,0,0 (readevents.py)
 	Take reading from PipesQKD.SB
 	Get number of seeded counts (col 5) a few times (TBD).
	Store average + std dev (not globals, maybe local to readevents.py.
		                       Should be re-taken often enough for current count rates.)

2. Check if seeding is seen (controller.py)
	Call readevents with -b 145,880,0 (readevents.py)
	Take reading from PipesQKD.SB
	Compare col 5 value with step (1)
		diff = (value - expected)/expected
   if diff > 3 sigma: (controller.py)
	seeding seen
   if diff < 3 sigma
        seeding not seen

1. Where is best place to store the expected value without seeding?
2. How to manage pipes? Separate pipes with separate readevent processes?
Current pipe setup seems to be streamlined for process calls with one set of params.
